//c++ iterator
//for (iterator container.begin(), iter != container.end(), iter++){
//  cont << iter->data;
//}

//accessing data through iterator is independent of advancing through iterator

//java iterator
//while (iter hasnext()){
//  object data = iternext();
//  System.out.println(data);

//every node should contain a reference count of number of pointers pointing to the node at any given time (always atleast 1 when in the list)
//if reference count is 0, delete item, free()

//head of list, pointer to comparator function, pointer to destroyer function
